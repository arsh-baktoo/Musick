He is recognized for his genre-melding musicianship and global influence in modern-day popular music. Bieber was discovered by American record executive Scooter Braun and signed with RBMG Records in 2008, gaining recognition with the release of his debut seven-track EP My World and soon establishing himself as a teen idol.\nBieber achieved commercial success with his teen pop-driven debut studio album, My World 2.0, which debuted atop the US Billboard 200, making him the youngest solo male act to top the chart in 47 years. The album spawned the internationally successful single "Baby", which became one of the best selling singles of all time in the US. His second studio album, Under the Mistletoe, became the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut at number one in the US. Bieber experimented with dance-pop in his third studio album, Believe, and went on to become the first artist in history with five US number-one albums by the age of 18. From 2013–14, Bieber was involved in multiple controversies and legal issues, which had a drastic impact on his public image.\n\nFrom Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber) under Creative Commons Attribution CC-BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode)'}, {'name': 'Snow Patrol', 'img': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD_cMMSkhcaatck2CRCNzdr0Aylg1oekxMrKT9tTcSCNfOxuVP8=w2880-h1200-p-l90-rj', 'bio': 'Over a two-decade career, Snow Patrol has carved out a unique place for themselves. Since their 1998 debut, Songs for Polarbears, which Pitchfork hailed as “an impressive piece of work,” their melancholy anthems of heartbreak and separation have mended hearts, and the band has racked up an impressive number of critical and commercial accolades, including 15 million global album sales, 1+ billion global track streams, 5 UK Platinum Albums, and are Grammy and Mercury Music Prize nominated.\n\nThey emerged as heartsore musical prophets in the shadow of grunge and shallow pop, striking a chord in the minds, memories and hearts of listeners over six groundbreaking, confessional albums.\n\nEyes Open, released in 2006, was the biggest-selling album in the UK that year; they went on to headline such festivals as the prestigious T in the Park. But after their Fallen Empires tour ended in 2012, band members — guitarist, vocalist Gary Lightbody, guitarists Johnny McDaid and Nathan Connolly, bassist Paul Wilson, and drummer Jonny Quinn — decided to stop for a while.\n\n“We were exhausted at the end of the tour,” says Lightbody. “We went from album to tour, album to tour for 10 years.\n\nWe needed to take a break. And it just kind of kept extending. It wasn’t that we planned to take six years off by any means.\n\n“We all started living our own lives and realizing that we actually had lives outside of the band, a band that we still had an awful lot of fondness for and that we did want to come back to, I just perhaps needed more time than I first thought,” explains Lightbody.\n\n“I do think the rest of the band would have been ready to record at any point over the last five years. But they never showed frustration or anger. Never did they say, ‘Hurry up and write the songs, mate.’”\n\nIn the interim, Quinn started a family and began putting in more\n\nSebastian in 2014). Connolly formed and fronted Little Matador, the band he started with a number of other prominent Irish and American musicians, including Dave Magee from Lafaro and Gavin Fox from Idlewild. Wilson signed on as the touring guitarist in Foo Fighters bassist Nate Mendel’s band Lieutenant, and produced a number of bands, including L.A. newcomers Broken Arrow. McDaid wrote songs and produced such diverse artists as Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, Robbie Williams, Ed Sheeran and Pink, and executive-produced Kodaline’s third album, due out this year.\n\nLightbody put the finishing touches on The Ghost of the Mountain, the second album by his Tired Pony side project with members of Belle and Sebastian, R.E.M, Reindeer Section and Fresh Young Fellows. He then moved to Los Angeles and began writing songs for movies (including “This Is How You Walk On” for 2017’s Gifted), and doing a number of high-profile co-writes with Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift and One Direction. Songs that weren’t pulled from his own psyche were less painful to craft, and went a long way into healing what he considered to be writer’s block.\n\nAnd at his website (www.garylightbody.com) he posted 15 cover versions of favorite songs by the likes of Ryan Adams, Bon Iver, Tom Waits and Glen Campbell.\n\nBut something else unexpectedly stimulated his writing even more. Two years ago he quit drinking. “Drinking was the only place I could hide from myself and if I was drunk I wasn’t depressed, just the next day but that could be remedied with more drink.” But he didn’t want that anymore.\n\n“I’d been writing songs for years about love, been down that road so many times before:  love, the end of love, the beginning of love. Mostly the end of love, to be honest. And I just knew that this album had to be something different. I hadn’t been in a relationship for some time and had no material to draw on. I had to look both deeper inside myself and out into the wider world around me and both seemed to be in chaos.”\n\nWhich is what he did for Snow Patrol’s seventh album. Titled Wildness, it taps into something raw and primitive.\n\n“There are many types of wildness,” says Lightbody, “but I think it can be distilled into two: the wildness of the modern age and something more primal, something we were born with but forget so quickly now because of our addiction to ourselves, to social media, to everything faster, everything now. The level of hate and confusion and illogic and anger and spite that have come up like a torrent recently. That’s the ugly kind of wildness. But there is a beautiful side of wildness, our connectivity to each other, our passion, our love. It’s more and more being forgotten and dulled, because the modern noise is dialed up so loud that we can’t hear the other kind. I want to remember.”\n\nThat’s not the only thing Lightbody wanted to remember. His father, Jack, is suffering from dementia, making the musician realize how important it to hold on to your memories for as long as you can.\n\nThe album kicks off with the grand “Life on Earth,” which finds the musician singing about the first snow (the first time the word snow has ever been used in a Snow Patrol song), the first winter, the first dance, the first light and the first day in a strange new land. It’s a theme he returns to in “A Youth Written in Fire,” remembering another series of firsts, more dreamy and bittersweet, memories gathered up like pressed flowers in a book.\n\n“I think the album is defined by memory in a lot of ways,” says Lightbody. “My father’s loss of memory, fading and frayed memories of my youth and my own sense of frustration when I can’t remember my own song lyrics.\n\n“Maybe most of all, I think this album is the return from disaster. ‘ Disaster Button’ [from 2008’s A Hundred Million Suns] only presented questions. This album tries to have some answers. I think it’s the first record I’ve ever written that I haven’t just asked a bunch of questions. I actually tried to figure out why I was unhappy, why I feel out of place, why I’m afraid. I think my attitude towards relationships has changed. I think I’ve been protecting myself for whatever reason. There’s nothing really to protect myself for. It’s all in the album.”\n\nThat’s especially vivid on “Youth Written in Fire,” a Game of Thrones-ian epic that came to life when Lightbody was left alone in producer Garrett “Jacknife” Lee’s Topanga Canyon studio and put Nick Cave’s “Jesus Alone” on repeat.\n\n“It created this kind of clamor of thought in my brain. When it was clear I was obsessed, Garrett said to me, “I’m just gonna leave this running. You just keep listening to the song.”\n\n“That is the genius of Jacknife Lee, “Lightbody continues. “He knows when to push and when to step back. If I wrote these songs he built them. Built them from the ground up like skyscrapers. I can’t see what he sees. The song is in its final form in his head as he’s listening to me play the melody for the first time. It’s an extraordinary gift. One I’m truly grateful for as his contribution is way more than just producer, it’s co-writer and co-conspirator.”\n\n“That day Jacknife and Nathan left me in the studio with Jesus Alone playing on repeat and I started writing, and I wrote the whole song from word one to the last word in the minutes after I heard the car drive away. It was like this massive crescendo of noise and cacophony and that terrifying bass on that song that was rumbling through me, jarring things loose.”\n\nHe continues, “After that, I went back to other songs and listened to them and thought, ‘Now I get it. This is an album about all the things that I’m afraid of.’ But instead of looking away or recoiling I wanted to stare right at them and not blink. I wanted to go deeper into the darkness. It took me a long time to recover after writing this album and I fell into a very deep depression because I had never went so far down into those places before. My alcoholism, my dad’s dementia, my bleaker thoughts, and of course the world and what was happening in it. Everything was fair game when I was writing. It’s just when I finished I thought there would be a sense of relief but that relief never came so it was hard to snap back into life again. I made my way back from it; it just took a while.\n\n“After that breakthrough on ‘A Youth Written In Fire’ though, everything seemed to flow. The writer’s block had vanished, and without me even realizing those songs had solidified into a record.”\n\nBut a record unlike anything that Snow Patrol had released in its 24-year career.\n\n“We’ve been playing the album to our friends and they’ve reacted in various ways, most of them positively,” says Lightbody. “But they all say it doesn’t sound like Snow Patrol of past times.”\n\nThe rest of the band members rose to the occasion. “Everyone played out of their fricking skin on this record. The drums are just incredible. At certain points everybody did things that they’d never done before and played well out of their comfort zones,” says Lightbody.\n\nYou can certainly feel the difference in the tracks, starting with the plaintive, wracked lyrics of album opener “Life on Earth,” with its mission statement, “This is something else, this is something else.” The songs sound surefooted, displaying a newfound sense of self and purpose. “Don’t Give In,” one of the more recent tunes Lightbody wrote, is likely the best advice he’s ever given. You can feel the passage through pain in the lyrics and feel the choices that the musician made in his road out of doubt and fear. It’s an inspirational as it is beautiful.\n\n“Heal Me” feels like an ancient hymn. “Finally after way too many years of smashing my body to bits with booze and living way too unhealthily I met someone who helped me find my way back to health,” says Lightbody. “This song is about her, that journey and is dedicated to her.”\n\n“Empress,” written for Lightbody’s two goddaughters (Jacknife’s daughters Betsey and Esme), is fierce and heartfelt, with runaway drums and keen words of wisdom. “A Dark Switch” is something else altogether. Slinkier than before, sexier even.\n\n“What If This Is All The Love You Ever Get?” is a heartstring-puller, posing the question nobody wants to ask. “You know if that’s true, I’m genuinely okay with that,” says Lightbody. “I’m not trying to look for love. I think I’ve spent enough time now on my own to actually like myself now.”\n\n“Soon” is about the unbreakable connection between a father and son, playing with the space-time continuum and revealing a series of real or imagined moments between Lightbody and his father. “Wild Horses” takes nothing from the Rolling Stones hit of the same name except perhaps its fierce pacing. It’s a note to self, instructing the protagonist to aim higher, to love bigger, to dream more, and to just let go of your fears. Which is what Lightbody has done on this album, allowing the listener to witness him slaying his own dragons.\n\nThe last track, “Life and Death,” shimmers with light and revelation. It’s a rumination, a human story of love and forgiveness demonstrating that perhaps everyone ought to take this long between albums to reflect long and hard before they write.\n\n“Seamus Heaney, my favorite poet of all time, said at 71 that he was only discovering what some of [his] poetry means. And this is coming from a Nobel Prize-winning poet. [It’s] a great testament to inspiration. It makes you aware that we’re hardly in control of what we’re writing at all. In fact, on good days we’re not at all. Because on bad days you try to wring words out of the pen like a dirty dish towel, to have something fall on the page. But on good days you can’t stop yourself. You’re writing reams and reams and reams. It might not all be golden but it’s glowing.”\n\n“I had so few of those days on this record. Everything was eked out, and I think that I just got used to it. I didn’t stop until it was right, until it was done. Sometimes you write with inspiration and you look back on it in five years and think, ‘I wish I’d put more time into that.’ Sometimes it takes you five years to write the thing. Like now. And you know for sure when you finish an album like that everything makes sense and I bet you I’m never not proud of this record.”'}, {'name': 'Current Joys', 'img': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RmUCsjblF3Wy8ahnONwnUkLVOwR1_xqpltYtog_V1daknCkAwubpiPbsvATpOg8xciKljre7hOmqHQ=w2880-h1200-p-l90-rj', 'bio': 'Nicholas Foster Rattigan is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, vocalist, journalist and music video director, originating from Reno, Nevada.

Inspired by his unforgettable experiences over the past decade and the artist within, Mike has just released a brand new Fort Minor song and video titled, “Welcome.” Among the world’s first 360-degree virtual reality (VR) music videos, Shinoda and his collaborators at The Uprising Creative in LA joined forces to fully leverage the power of VR. The result is a unique experience set in Venice Beach where everyone is invited.\n\nWELCOME will create a moment to bring together the underdogs, the outcasts, the shy, and the uninvited. To go against the overwhelming divisiveness in our world by inviting people in rather than pushing them away. Through a buoyant, tenacious, confident tone, WELCOME speaks from the outsider to the outsider. It’s a hip hop song with a punk, DIY ethos. \n\nShot in VR/360, the video captures the local community vibe of Venice Beach, where Mike painted a giant canvas mural with original design right on the infamous boardwalk. Director Jeff Nicholas and his colleagues at The Uprising Creative, captured it all with a GoPro-based VR rig. The next day, the crew used a similar set up to photograph the finished 12x80 foot canvas in 360-degrees, with Shinoda playing drums, guitar and keyboards on the track. The mural was later broken apart into individual album sleeves signed by Mike, that will be used for the upcoming limited-edition release of the vinyl single.\n\nTo experience the music video for “Welcome” in 360 head to www.FortMinor.com or YouTube.com/FortMinor.

Raised by his mother, Afeni Shakur, he relocated to Baltimore in 1984 and to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1988. With the release of his debut album 2Pacalypse Now in 1991, he became a central figure in West Coast hip hop for his conscious rap lyrics. Shakur achieved further critical and commercial success with his follow-up albums Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... and Me Against the World.

But where E*MO*TION, which featured the platinum single "I Really Like You," was an ’80s-influenced synth-pop classic that Rolling Stone called “a pop masterclass” and Stereogum called “indisputable, unfuckwithable pop genius,” Dedicated has a more ’70s-inspired feel at times (though the album defies categorization as a whole). At one point, Jepsen was sure she was making a disco opus. “The title was going to be ‘Disco Sweat,’” she says with a laugh. “I really bought into it.” But Jepsen had a change of heart thanks to her travels over the past two years, which included writing trips to the Swedish countryside (“It was spring and there were fields of flowers, homemade breads, and kittens running everywhere”) and a beach in Nicaragua, where she surfed and stayed in a cabana-like casita. Then there was an Eat Pray Love-esque solo vacation in Italy. “I had so many songs,” she says. “I needed some space to walk around, reflect, eat pasta, and get to know myself a bit.”\n\nEventually Jepsen landed on what she thought was a finished album, “but then I just kept trying to beat it,” she said. “It became like a Tetris game of replacing songs when something new started to feel like it was winning.” Working with a crew of trusted songwriters and producers, among them John Hill, Jack Antonoff, Captain Cuts, Kyle Shearer, James Flannigan, Patrik Berger, and her longtime collaborator Tavish Crowe, Jepsen indulged in more sonic experimentation than she has in the past. “Whatever my mood is in life, it very much affects what I’m writing,” she says. “So maybe one of these emo songs fits, one of the disco songs fits. We can use three infatuation songs, but beyond that people are going to be sick. Even though the songs were written in different places with different people, they all feel like what my life has been like over the past three years.”\n\nIn November 2018, Jepsen released “Party for One,” an empowering ode to the necessity of loving yourself before anyone else can love you — a message she describes as “huge to me.”  The song “Julien,” which was inspired by a guy Jepsen met with that name, considers the idea of timeless love. “The first thing out of my mouth when I met this guy was, ‘You have the most beautiful name,’” she recalls. “Julien” paved the way for Dedicated, which finds her reflecting on the idea of what it means to be that committed to someone. “That’s where the title came from,” she says. “I thought about the word ‘dedicated’ and how it’s about being there for someone through thick and thin. It\'s something I thought about a lot while making this album, so it felt like a fitting title.”\n\nConflicting feelings about her romantic relationships inspired the songs “Right Words Wrong Time” and “The Sound.” She also acknowledges how love can feel like an addiction on “No Drug Like Me,” which is about a relationship that feels impossible but you’re willing to be terrified and go for it anyway. “Too Much.” “I think all people everywhere have, at some point or another, experienced a similar worry that ‘too much’ is a bad thing, when it’s in fact a great thing,” she says. “This song was my discovery of that. The insecurities of that even.” \n\n “Now That I Found You” is about the bliss of finding new, securely attached love. There are also bold, cheeky songs like “Everything He Needs,” (a reinterpretation of the love song in the Disney film Popeye) and “Want You in My Room,” which Jepsen describes as an “all-out unabashed come-on song.”\n\n“There aren’t a lot of hopeless romantics left out there,” Jepsen says. “But I believe in it. Romantic love is always going to come with some sort of euphoric high to me, so I keep singing about it. Even though a million songs have been written about it, I’ll still contribute my couple thousand, so by the time I\'m gone, you\'ll know that I was a believer, too.”'}, {'name': 'Niall Horan', 'img': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q8m4YJu7QtmEpWZQUCRI596T7QnGSkmOwKOLRgIKNjfVBsrQKwokX-kYEaDbOwWmGcoV288Vav_JVw=w2880-h1200-p-l90-rj', 'bio': 'Niall James Horan is an Irish singer-songwriter.

"When someone pointed that out, I was like, \'Fucking hell, we\'re men now!\'" laughs Miles Kane, co-frontman of the Puppets with Alex Turner. "Our balls have dropped."\nOwen Pallett, who arranged the strings and horns on The Age of Understatement, had the same thought when he once again reported for Shadow Puppets duty last year. "I had run into Alex at festivals, so I saw him through his sort of longhaired gym-queen look to his current slick rockabilly style," says the Canadian genius and Domino labelmate. "But Miles I hadn\'t seen at all since he was twenty one. So when I saw him again it was like, \'Oh my god, you\'re an adult!\' It was so shocking to see this guy who\'d been like a cheeky schoolboy turn into a guy who literally owned my ass."\nSuffice it to say that other obligations came between The Age of Understatement and its sophomore successor, not least the unstoppable rise of Turner\'s Arctic Monkeys, who released not one but three hugely successful albums between 2008 and 2013. "I wish I had a more flowery answer, but there just wasn\'t a chance to do a second album before now," Turner says. "The Age of Understatement exceeded our expectations, but it was cut short because it was never assumed that we would take it on the road. And then we had to get back to our other bands." (Kane embarked on a solo career after disbanding his trio the Rascals in the summer of 2009 and subsequently released two albums on Columbia.)\nNeither Kane nor Turner ever intended to put the Puppets on the back burner where so many "side projects" languish in perpepuity: the creative outlet that the act offered to the two friends was far too important for that. "The Age of Understatement was the first time I\'d looked at lyrics as just another element of the recording, along with the melody and the rest of the music," says Turner. "Before that, every song I\'d written had been \'about something\' – in inverted commas – and this was the first time I\'d started to look at the lyrics more as a component – not putting focus on it but thinking about the shadow it cast on the wall rather than the object itself. It was like dipping a toe in the abstract for the first time." \nJust as The Age of Understatement enabled the duo to explore an all-but-forgotten world of epic \'60s pop that contrasted starkly with the indie guitar-rock template of the Monkeys and the Rascals, so the second coming of the Shadow Puppets has given Kane and Turner new avenues that veer radically away from their other work. In fact, several of the songs on Everything You\'ve Come to Expect have been germinating ever since the Monkeys finally came off the road after touring the mighty AM in November 2014. "We\'ve been writing these tunes sporadically over the last couple of years," says Turner. \nTurner is all too aware that the "story" of Everything You\'ve Come to Expect could be reduced somewhat crassly to the fact that both he and Kane now live in Los Angeles – and that the album was cut at Rick Rubin\'s Shangri-La studio, the Malibu home to The Band in their Last Waltz heyday. "I\'d love for it to be neat and tidy, like \'We\'re living here so it sounds like this\'," he says, "but it\'s not really like that. When I listen to the album, I think of other cities – London and Paris – as much as I think of LA." Kane concurs: "It wasn\'t like a big \'Let\'s make an L.A. record\' kind of thing. It was more just, \'Well, we\'re here, let\'s do it here.\'"\nBoth men, however, admit that some distinctly American influences did seep into the album\'s songs, even if they\'re less detectable than the influences of Scott Walker, John Barry, and Ennio Morricone were on its predecessor. "There were some Todd Rundgren songs, and a Ned Doheny album called Hard Candy," says Turner, who also concedes that recording in his adopted city was the "green juice that softened the edges" of the Puppets\' sound at Shangri-La. Another, slightly more improbable influence was that of Paul Weller\'s Style Council. "I definitely wasn\'t listening to them when we made the first Puppets record," Turner admits. "With \'Long Hot Summer\' there\'s a sort of shimmery quality to that that we tried to introduce into the sonics of this album, and even melodically."\nFor Owen Pallett, who this time worked more in situ with the band in the studio, the songs weren\'t so much American or Californian as simply more open and expansive. "There was a lot more space for my orchestral work," he says. "With the first record we talked about Scott Walker and David Axelrod as reference points for where they wanted the orchestrations to go. With this record I asked if they had any new reference points and they said, \'Have you heard of a record called The Age of Understatement?\' So I was kind of pulling from my own private sources." One of those turned out to be a classic of orchestral soul by Isaac Hayes, scored in 1969 by Detroit arranger Johnny Allen. "There were a couple of songs we were kind of struggling with," Pallett says, "so one night we listened to Hot Buttered Soul and then went back and rewrote a couple of the arrangements."\n"I think working next door from us led Owen to different conclusions than last time, when we didn\'t have that luxury," says Turner. "He wanted to do less than he\'d done before. He\'s an incredible talent. We\'d just wind him up and let him go."\nWhat strikes one on initial exposure to Everything You\'ve Come to Expect is that it wears its influences less obviously on its sleeve. While the Puppets\' sound remains anchored in ferry-\'cross-the-Merseybeat sweep and romance – in the lost pop world of Brylcreemed Billy Fury – their new songs take us into the realm of Curt Boettcher (the title track\'s bittersweet sunshine pop) and Roy Orbison (the bolero-driven croonerama of \'Sweet Dreams, TN\'). If lead single \'Bad Habits\' is jaggedly snarling, \'Miracle Aligner\' and \'Dracula Teeth\' are seductive and melodically pining. \n"I think what makes this record slightly different is that me and Al have found our voices more from when we did our first one," says Miles Kane. "Obviously we\'ve done more singing in that time, so we\'d each sort of sit back and let the other one do his bit on the right songs. Like on \'Sweet Dreams\', I think Al\'s vocals are unbelievable, the way he soars on it and the way he croons. Whereas I can deliver the slightly punkier things like \'Bad Habits\', I find that easier. But then you have that middle ground of songs like \'Used to Be My Girl\' and \'Aviation\' between those bookends. With the close harmonies on, say, \'Dracula Teeth\' and \'Element of Surprise\', they sort of blend into each other, so on those more sparkly tunes that was a new thing that developed for me – to make beautiful, sexy vocals."\n"I love the first record, but I can\'t even compare it to this new one," says Owen Pallett. "This one takes far more chances, and the stylistic detours don\'t feel quite so out of step. There are many more interesting turns and twists. Lyrically there\'s a lot more depth to it." Pallett won\'t resort to rock-critical tropes of "maturity" and "growing up", preferring to see Everything You\'ve Come to Expect in the context of change. "People like Alex and Miles – are always flipping the script, never trying to go back and make the same record."\n"How important is it to be looking over your shoulder?" says Turner. "Is it not more exciting, rather than trying to hold on to something – or to someone\'s perception of something – to let that go and explore what\'s in front of you, regardless of the green juice and the palm trees?"\nFor Owen Pallett, the Last Shadow Puppets remain a kind of "vacation home" for Kane and Turner, a place where – in collaboration with bassist Zach Dawes and drummer/producer James Ford – they can "cut loose a little bit and just have fun".\n"The whole point of The Age of Understatement was that there was no agenda," reflects Kane. "We didn\'t even know whether we\'d put an album out. It\'s different now, because we\'ve both done things and obviously know about the Puppets. Yet we\'re still best friends and that\'s still the root of it, really. That\'s the buzz of it."'}, {'name': 'OneRepublic', 'img': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8NOpUYB7nTsAMcpoRTnJVCsaJjS8a-rLUMGEkBpShczDEvWRvP0Fd0qc6hcmTSA1nrYRIL_4IY4t1u5o=w2880-h1200-p-l90-rj', 'bio': 'Grammy nominated OneRepublic, is comprised of singer/songwriter and lead vocalist Ryan Tedder, guitarists Zach Filkins and Drew Brown, keys Brian Willett, bassist and cellist Brent Kutzle, and drummer Eddie Fisher.

Puth co-wrote every song and recorded and produced the album entirely himself (barring one song he co- produced with Max Martin) mainly at his home studio in Los Angeles.\n\nA meticulously crafted game-changer replete with sparkling melodies and sleek, danceable grooves, Voicenotes decimates everything people may think they know about this musical polymath, who has not only written and produced his own massive hits, but also for other artists spanning a range of genres, including Jason Derulo, Trey Songz, Thomas Rhett, Maroon 5, and G-Eazy. On Voicenotes, Puth allows himself to truly be seen, not only as an artist but also as a human, which meant stepping out from behind the detached façade of lovelorn balladeering and being transparent about his emotions and influences.\n\nOn the lyrical front, Voicenotes is an album that is largely about Puth’s struggle to find a normal relationship when his own life has hardly been normal since finding multiplatinum success, and the anxiety that pursuit has induced. “I wanted it to be a story of my travels from the East Coast to the West Coast and how my growing fame has affected my mind in good and bad ways,” he says. The first three singles — “Attention,” “How Long,” and “Done For Me” featuring Kehlani — cover that territory. “Whenever I met anybody, they often knew more about me than I knew about myself,” he says. “I’d never dealt with anything like that before.” Songs like “LA Girls,” “Like A Boy,” and “Slow It Down” detail different aspects of the rarified life of someone who feels like he should be enjoying the glittering lifestyle of fabulous parties and ample romantic opportunities, but just doesn’t — something Puth addresses on self-acceptance anthem “The Way I Am,” which opens with the following lines: “Maybe I’m a get a little anxious / Maybe I’m a get a little shy / Cuz everybody’s trying to be famous / And I’m just trying to find a place to hide”).\n\n“I thought I was supposed to go to all these parties and be this type of person so I’ve always shoved my anxiety under the carpet because I didn’t think anyone cared to hear about it,” he says. “This album touches on that, but I also wanted to make sure that these songs, at the end of the day, are fun because some people choose not to listen to the lyrics. They just want to go to the club, listen to the beat, and have a great time. And that’s totally fine, too.”'}, {'name': 'Iron Maiden', 'img': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nhiZLMxjoxcIOcjrMr_Es_0ARMq0iCMkcfMivwQZrF5UL0kJwUthJIAH6dnQstu3MbmyyPGX5RazQ9E=w2880-h1200-p-l90-rj', 'bio': "Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton, East London, in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris. Although fluid in the early years of the band, the line-up for most of the band's history has consisted of Harris, lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson, drummer Nicko McBrain, and guitarists Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers. As pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal movement, Iron Maiden released a series of UK and US Platinum and Gold albums, including 1980's debut album, 1981's Killers, and 1982's The Number of the Beast – its first album with Bruce Dickinson, who replaced Paul Di'Anno as lead singer. The addition of Dickinson was a turning point in their career, establishing them as one of heavy metal's most important artists. The Number of the Beast is among the most popular heavy metal albums of all time, having sold almost 20 million copies worldwide.\nAfter some turbulence in the 1990s, the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999 saw the band undergo a resurgence in popularity, with a series of new albums and highly successful tours.\n\nFrom Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden) under Creative Commons Attribution CC-BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode)"}, {'name': 'Demi Lovato', 'img': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TPakQwVVZnroJ-V3ENYVTWkiqUabsI3dO6ubKhqoYtCq8SuSCFC7H0Xm9M_Ol3mWHtVX1zfZeeeMx84=w2880-h1200-p-l90-rj', 'bio': 'Demetria Devonne "Demi" Lovato is an American singer, songwriter, and actress.

Membership subsequently stabilised around the Young brothers with Bon Scott, Mark Evans and Phil Rudd. Evans was fired from the band in 1977 and replaced by Cliff Williams, who has since appeared on every album since Powerage. Seven months after the release of the band\'s breakthrough album Highway to Hell, Scott died of alcohol poisoning and the other members considered disbanding. However, at the request of Scott\'s parents, they continued together and recruited English singer Brian Johnson as their new frontman.

It was a widespread success, launching the band to new heights and becoming the second-best-selling album of all time.\nThe band\'s eighth studio album, For Those About to Rock, was their first album to reach number one in the United States.\n\nFrom Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC) under Creative Commons Attribution CC-BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode)'}, {'name': 'Jimi Hendrix', 'img': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fs3h1sEebLiRGK9XcFGrcvAP4JxQIHfc6cA1F-VenGS8Rnoi1az9DKcHtlTJEHuc13ew1rKg_TihUYts=w2880-h1200-p-l90-rj', 'bio': 'James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix was an American guitarist, songwriter and singer.

In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army, but was discharged the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville then Nashville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the chitlin\' circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers\' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965.
